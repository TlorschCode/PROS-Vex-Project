Wheel diameter is 12.56
Use radians for Cmath cos and sin

Slow motors' velocities are +-100
Normal motors' velocities are +-200
Fast motors' velocities are +-600

Right side motors move forward with a positive velocity input

!! - 1.155 is the perfect amount for line 240 !!

OVERTHINKING is our next team name.
